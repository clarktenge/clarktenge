# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Clark Enge

## Introduction

My name is Clark enge and I am going into my third year at the University of California Santa Barbara where I am pursuing a major in Statistics & Data Science as well as completing the PaCE Certificate of Technology Management. I am intensly curious about the intersection of data and business analyics and using my skills to solve real world issues. I love data-driven decision marking and want to dive deep into the technical foundation of machine learning.

# Projects

[Outlier-Resistant A/B Test Simulation Study](https://github.com/clarktenge/AB-Simulation-Study)

Designed and implemented a large-scale simulation study to evaluate the robustness of A/B testing methods under varying levels of outliers, effect sizes, and sample sizes. Simulated over 1 million experiments across 100 unique scenarios in R to compare the standard t-test, Welchâ€™s t-test, and a 10% trimmed mean t-test. Assessed statistical power, conducted paired t-tests, and visualized results using ggplot2. Found that trimmed and Welch tests outperform under skewed, noisy data conditions, providing practical recommendations for real-world experimentation.

[Predictive Algorithm for March Madness](https://github.com/clarktenge/Predictive-Algorithm-for-March-Madness-)

Built an NCAA Menâ€™s Basketball tournament predictor using Python, NumPy, and Pandas. Analyzed **20+ years of historical tournament data** using SQL to rank and weight predictive metrics such as 3PT%, FT%, and Points Per Game. Simulated full brackets based on a custom scoring system, achieving **25% Final Four prediction accuracy** in 2017 and 2018, outperforming baseline models by over 15%.
